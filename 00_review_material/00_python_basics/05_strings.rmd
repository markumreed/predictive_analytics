# Strings

- Strings are not like integers, floats, and booleans. 
- A string is a **sequence**, which means it is an ordered collection of other values. 

## A string is a sequence

- A string is a sequence of characters
- You can access the characters one at a time with the bracket operator:


```python
fruit = 'coconut'
letter = fruit[1]
letter
```




    'o'



The expression in brackets is called an index. The index indicates which character in the sequence you want (hence the name).


```python
fruit = 'coconut'
letter = fruit[1]
letter
```




    'o'



- For most people, the first letter of 'coconut' is c, not o. 
- But for computer scientists, the index is an offset from the beginning of the string, and the offset of the first letter is zero.


```python
letter = fruit[0]
letter
```




    'c'



## len
**len** is a built-in function that returns the number of characters in a string:


```python
fruit = 'lime'
len(fruit)
```




    4



To get the last letter of a string, you might be tempted to try something like this:


```python
length = len(fruit)
fruit[4]
```


    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    IndexError                                Traceback (most recent call last)

    <ipython-input-10-9c7dbe8f62db> in <module>()
          1 length = len(fruit)
    ----> 2 fruit[4]
    

    IndexError: string index out of range


- The reason for the `IndexError` is that there is no letter in ’banana’ with the index 6. 

- Since we started counting at zero, the six letters are numbered 0 to 5. 

- To get the last character, you have to subtract 1 from length:


```python
fruit[len(fruit) - 1]
```




    'a'



Or you can use negative indices, which count backward from the end of the string.


```python
fruit[-1]
```

## Traversal with a for loop

- A lot of computations involve processing a string one character at a time 

- Often they start at the beginning, select each character in turn, do something to it, and continue until the end

    - This pattern of processing is called a **traversal**. 

One way to write a traversal is with a while loop:


```python
fruit = 'kiwi'
index = 0
while index < len(fruit):
    letter = fruit[index]
    print(letter)
    index = index + 1
```

Another way to write a traversal is with a for loop:


```python
for letter in fruit:
    print(letter)
```

## Example: Concatenation

The following example shows how to use concatenation (string addition) and a for loop to generate an abecedarian series (that is, in alphabetical order). In Robert McCloskey’s book Make Way for Ducklings, the names of the ducklings are Jack, Kack, Lack, Mack, Nack, Ouack, Pack, and Quack. This loop outputs these names in order:




```python
prefixes = 'JKLMNOPQ'
suffix = 'ack'

for letter in prefixes:
    print(letter + suffix)
```

    Jack
    Kack
    Lack
    Mack
    Nack
    Oack
    Pack
    Qack


## Example: In-class question

Notice that Ouack and Quack are misspelled: How do you fix this?


```python
prefixes = 'JKLMNOPQ'
suffix = 'ack'

for letter in prefixes:
    if letter == 'O' or letter == 'Q':
        print(letter + 'u' + suffix)
    else:
        print(letter + suffix)
```

    Jack
    Kack
    Lack
    Mack
    Nack
    Ouack
    Pack
    Quack


## String slices

**Slice:** a segment of a string.
- Selecting a slice is similar to selecting a character
- The operator `[n:m]` returns the part of the string from the $n^{th}$ character to the $m^{th}$ character
    - including the first but excluding the last.


```python
s = 'Henderson Reddies'
s[0:9]
```


```python
s[10:17]
```

- If you omit the first index (before the colon), the slice starts at the beginning of the string. 
- If you omit the second index, the slice goes to the end of the string:


```python
fruit = 'peach'
fruit[:3]
```


```python
fruit[3:]
```

## Strings are immutable

- You cannot use the `[]` operator to change characters in a string:


```python
greeting = 'Hello, students!'
greeting[0] = 'J'
```

The reason for the error is that strings are immutable, which means you can’t change an existing string. 

The best you can do is create a new string that is a variation on the original:


```python
greeting = 'Hello, students!'
new_greeting = 'J' + greeting[1:]
new_greeting
```

This example concatenates a new first letter onto a slice of greeting. It has no effect on the original string.

## Search

What does the following function do?

```python
def find(word, letter):
    index = 0
    while index < len(word):
        if word[index] == letter:
            return index
        index = index + 1
    return -1
```

- In a sense, find is the inverse of the `[]` operator. Instead of taking an index and extracting the corresponding character, it takes a character and finds the index where that character appears. If the character is not found, the function returns -1.

- This pattern of computation—traversing a sequence and returning when we find what we are looking for—is called a **search**.

## Looping and counting

This program counts the number of times the letter a appears in a string:

```python
word = 'mississippi'
count = 0
for letter in word:
    if letter == 'i':
        count = count + 1
print(count)
```
This program demonstrates another pattern of computation called a counter. The variable count is initialized to 0 and then incremented each time an a is found. When the loop exits, count contains the result—the total number of a’s.

## String methods

- Strings provide methods that perform a variety of useful operations. 
- A method is similar to a function—it takes arguments and returns a value—but the syntax is different.

Instead of the function syntax `upper(word)`, it uses the method syntax `word.upper()`.


```python
word = 'reddie'
new_word = word.upper()
new_word
```

```python
new_word = word.upper()
```

- This form of dot notation specifies the name of the method, upper, and the name of the string to apply the method to, word. 

- The empty parentheses indicate that this method takes no arguments.

- A method call is called an **invocation**;

## in operator

The word `in` is a boolean operator that takes two strings and returns `True` if the first appears as a substring in the second:


```python
'e' in 'reddie'
```


```python
'f' in 'reddie'
```

## Example

The following function prints all the letters from word1 that also appear in word2:


```python
def in_both(word1, word2):
    for letter in word1:
        if letter in word2:
            print(letter)
```


```python
in_both('Henderson', 'Reddies')
```

## String comparison

The relational operators work on strings. To see if two strings are equal:


```python
word = 'apple'
if word == 'banana':
    print('All right, bananas.')
```

Other relational operations are useful for putting words in alphabetical order:


```python
word = 'banana' # Try apple and pineapple
if word < 'banana':
    print('Your word, ' + word + ', comes before banana.')
elif word > 'banana':
    print('Your word, ' + word + ', comes after banana.')
else:
    print('All right, bananas.')
```
