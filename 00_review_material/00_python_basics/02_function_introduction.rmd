# Functions: Part 1
**function** is a named sequence of statements that performs a computation. 

- When you define a function, you specify the name and the sequence of statements. 

- Later, you can “call” the function by name.

## Function calls

We've already see a **function call**:


```python
type(42)
```




    int



- The name of the function is type. 

- The expression in parentheses is called the argument of the function. 

- The result, for this function, is the type of the **argument**.

- It is common to say that a function “takes” an argument and “returns” a result. The result is also called the **return value**.


```python
int('32') # string to int
```




    32




```python
int('Hello')
```


    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)

    <ipython-input-3-6765ce49acfe> in <module>()
    ----> 1 int('Hello')
    

    ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'Hello'



```python
float(32) # int / string to float
```




    32.0




```python
float('3.14')
```




    3.14




```python
str(31) # int / float to string
```




    '31'



## Math functions

Python has a math module that provides most of the familiar mathematical functions. 

- A **module** is a file that contains a collection of related functions.

- Before we can use the functions in a module, we have to import it with an **import statement**:



```python
import math
```

This statement creates a **module object** named math. 


```python
math
```




    <module 'math' from '/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/lib-dynload/math.cpython-36m-darwin.so'>



The module object contains the functions and variables defined in the module. 

- To access one of the functions, you have to specify the name of the module and the name of the function, separated by a period. 

    - This format is called **dot notation**
    
### Example


```python
degrees = 45
radians = degrees / 180.0 * math.pi
math.sin(radians)
```




    0.7071067811865475



The expression `math.pi` gets the variable pi from the math module. 

Its value is a floating-point approximation of $\pi$, accurate to about 15 digits.


```python
math.pi
```

## New Functions

A **function definition** specifies the name of a new function and the sequence of statements that run when the function is called.


```python
def print_lyrics():
    print("Hello darkness my old friend")
    print("Pink fluffy unicorns!")
```

`def` is a keyword that indicates that this is a function definition.

Defining a function creates a **function object**, which has type function:


```python
type(print_lyrics)
```




    function




```python
print_lyrics()
```

    Hello darkness my old friend
    Pink fluffy unicorns!


Once you have defined a function, you can use it inside another function.


```python
def repeat_lyrics():
    print_lyrics()
    print_lyrics()
```


```python
repeat_lyrics()
```

    Hello darkness my old friend
    Pink fluffy unicorns!
    Hello darkness my old friend
    Pink fluffy unicorns!


## Definitions and Uses

Pulling together the code fragments from the previous section, the whole program looks like this:

```python
def print_lyrics():
    print("I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.")
    print("I sleep all night and I work all day.")

def repeat_lyrics():
    print_lyrics()
    print_lyrics()

repeat_lyrics()
```

This program contains two function definitions: `print_lyrics` and `repeat_lyrics`. 

You have to create a function before you can run it. In other words, the function definition has to run before the function gets called.

## Parameters and arguments

Some of the functions we have seen require arguments.

Inside the function, the arguments are assigned to variables called **parameters**. Here is a definition for a function that takes an argument:


```python
def print_twice(param):
    print(param)
    print(param)
```


```python
print_twice('Hello')
```

    Hello
    Hello



```python
print_twice(42)
```

    42
    42



```python
print_twice(math.pi)
```

    3.141592653589793
    3.141592653589793



```python
print_twice('Spam ' * 10)
```

    Spam Spam Spam Spam Spam Spam Spam Spam Spam Spam 
    Spam Spam Spam Spam Spam Spam Spam Spam Spam Spam 



```python
print_twice(math.cos(math.pi))
```

    -1.0
    -1.0


The argument is evaluated before the function is called, so in the examples the expressions `'Spam '*10` and `math.cos(math.pi)` are only evaluated once.


```python
spam = 'Spam is the king of breakfast!'
```


```python
print_twice(spam)
```

    Spam is the king of breakfast!
    Spam is the king of breakfast!


## Variables and parameters are local

When you create a variable inside a function, it is **local**, which means that it only exists inside the function. For example:


```python
def cat_twice(part1, part2):
    cat = part1 + part2
    print_twice(cat)
```

This function takes two arguments, concatenates them, and prints the result twice. Here is an example that uses it:


```python
line1 = 'Hello Darkness! '
line2 = 'Big Fluffy Unicorns!'
cat_twice(line1, line2)
```

    Hello Darkness! Big Fluffy Unicorns!
    Hello Darkness! Big Fluffy Unicorns!


When cat_twice terminates, the variable cat is destroyed. If we try to print it, we get an exception:


```python
print(cat)
```


    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

    <ipython-input-28-34599fba884e> in <module>()
    ----> 1 print(cat)
    

    NameError: name 'cat' is not defined


## Why functions

It may not be clear why it is worth the trouble to divide a program into functions. There are several reasons:

- Creating a new function gives you an opportunity to name a group of statements, which makes your program easier to read and debug.
- Functions can make a program smaller by eliminating repetitive code. Later, if you make a change, you only have to make it in one place.
- Dividing a long program into functions allows you to debug the parts one at a time and then assemble them into a working whole.
- Well-designed functions are often useful for many programs. Once you write and debug one, you can reuse it.
