# Lists
## List == Sequence

- **list:** sequence of values
- Values inside of lists are **elements** or **items**
- There are several ways to create a new list;
    - the simplest is to enclose the elements in square brackets `[]`


```python
[10,20,30,40] # list of 4 integers
```




    [10, 20, 30, 40]




```python
['Eli','Xu','Markum'] # list of 3 strings
```




    ['Eli', 'Xu', 'Markum']



- Elements of a list do NOT have to be the same type:


```python
['string',2.0,5,[10,20], True] # list of string, float, integer, another list
```




    ['string', 2.0, 5, [10, 20], True]



- A list within another list is **nested**

A list that contains no items is an **empty list**


```python
[]
```




    []



- You can assign values to variables


```python
people = ['Eli','Xu','Markum']
numbers = [3,6,9]
empty = []
print(people, numbers, empty)
```

    ['Eli', 'Xu', 'Markum'] [3, 6, 9] []


## Lists are Mutable
- Syntax for accessing the elements of a list is the same as for accessing the characters of a string—the bracket operator.
- The expression inside the brackets specifies the index. Remember that the indices start at 0:


```python
people[0]
```




    'Eli'




```python
pep = ['e','x','m',[0,'target']]
```


```python
pep[3][1]
```




    'target'



- Unlike strings, lists are mutable. When the bracket operator appears on the left side of an assignment, it identifies the element of the list that will be assigned.


```python
numbers = [10,20,30]
```


```python
numbers[1] = 21
```


```python
numbers
```




    [10, 21, 30]



List indices work the same way as string indices:

- Any integer expression can be used as an index.
- If you try to read or write an element that does not exist, you get an `IndexError`.
- If an index has a negative value, it counts backward from the end of the list.

The `in` operator also works on lists:


```python
'Xu' in people
```




    True




```python
'Bob' in people
```




    False



## Traversing a list

The most common way to traverse the elements of a list is with a `for` loop. The syntax is the same as for strings:


```python
for p in people:
    print('Hello, ', p)
```

    Hello,  Eli
    Hello,  Xu
    Hello,  Markum



```python
people
```




    ['Eli', 'Xu', 'Markum']




```python
for num in [1,2,3]:
    num2 = num * 2
    print(num2)
```

    2
    4
    6


- This works well if you only need to read the elements of the list. 
- But if you want to write or update the elements, you need the indices. 
- A common way to do that is to combine the built-in functions `range` and `len`:


```python
numbers = [10, 20, 30]
for i in range(len(numbers)):
    numbers[i] = numbers[i] * 2
```


```python
numbers
```




    [20, 40, 60]



***How would we translate the above code into a function?***

Call the function `double_it` that takes a list, `t`.


```python
def double_it(t):
    """
    double_it takes a list and doubles the
    values inside.
    
    t: list
    """
    for i in range(len(t)):
        t[i] = t[i] * 2
    return t
```


```python
double_it([1,2,3])
```




    [2, 4, 6]



## List operations

The `+` operator **concatenates** lists:


```python
a = [1,2,3]
b = [4,5,6]
c = a + b
c
```




    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]



The `*` operator **repeats** a list a given number of times:


```python
[0] * 6
```




    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]




```python
[1, 2, 3] * 3 # Waltz sequence
```




    [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]



## List slices


```python
t = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
```


```python
t[1:3]
```




    ['b', 'c']




```python
t[:4]
```




    ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']




```python
t[2:]
```




    ['c', 'd', 'e', 'f']




```python
t[:]
```




    ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']



A slice operator on the left side of an assignment can update multiple elements:


```python
t[1:3] = ['Change', 'This']
```


```python
t
```




    [3, 'Change', 'This', 'test', 'test', 'test']



## List methods
Python provides methods that operate on lists. 
- `append` adds a new element to the end of a list:


```python
t = ['a','b','c']
t.append('d')
```


```python
t
```




    ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']



`extend` takes a list as an argument and appends all of the elements:


```python
t1 = ['a','b','c']
t2 = ['d','e']
t1.extend(t2)
```


```python
t1
```




    ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']



## Map, filter, reduce
### Reduce
An operation that combines a sequence of elements into a single value is called **reduce**.

To add up all the number in a list, you can use a loop:


```python
def add_all(t):
    total = 0
    for x in t:
        total += x
    return total
```


```python
add_all([1,2,3])
```




    6



- total is initialized to 0. 
- Each time through the loop, x gets one element from the list. 
- The += operator provides a short way to update a variable. 

```python
    total += x
```
is equivalent to

```python
    total = total + x
```

Adding up the elements of a list is such a common operation that Python provides it as a built-in function, `sum`:


```python
t = [1,2,3]
sum(t)
```




    6



### Map

Sometimes you want to traverse one list while building another. For example, the following function takes a list of strings and returns a new list that contains capitalized strings:


```python
def capitalize_all(t):
    res = []
    for s in t:
        res.append(s.capitalize())
    return res
```


```python
capitalize_all(['this','is','neat'])
```




    ['This', 'Is', 'Neat']



- res is initialized with an empty list; each time through the loop, we append the next element. 
- An operation like capitalize_all is called a **map** because it “maps” a function onto each of the elements in a sequence.

### Filter

An operation to select some of the elements from a list and return a sublist. For example, the following function takes a list of strings and returns a list that contains only the uppercase strings:


```python
def only_upper(t):
    res = []
    for s in t:
        if s.isupper():
            res.append(s)
    return res
```


```python
only_upper(['A','b','C'])
```




    ['A', 'C']



- `isupper` is a string method that returns `True` if the string contains only upper case letters.

- An operation like only_upper is called a **filter** because it selects some of the elements and filters out the others.

## Deleting Elements
There are several ways to delete elements from a list. If you know the index of the element you want, you can use `pop`:


```python
t = ['a','b','c']
x = t.pop(1)
```


```python
t
```




    ['a', 'c']




```python
x
```




    'b'



- `pop` modifies the list and returns the element that was removed. 
- If you don’t provide an index, it deletes and returns the last element.

If you don’t need the removed value, you can use the `del` operator:


```python
t = ['a','b','c']
del t[1]
```


```python
t
```




    ['a', 'c']



If you know the element you want to remove (but not the index), you can use `remove`:


```python
t = ['a', 'b', 'c']
t.remove('b')
```


```python
t
```




    ['a', 'c']



To remove more than one element, you can use `del` with a slice index:


```python
t = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
del t[1:5]
```


```python
t
```




    ['a', 'f']



## Lists and strings
A string is a sequence of characters and a list is a sequence of values, but a list of characters is not the same as a string. To convert from a string to a list of characters, you can use `list`:




```python
test = 'test'
t = list(test)
```


```python
t
```




    ['t', 'e', 's', 't']



- The `list` function breaks a string into individual letters. 
- If you want to break a string into words, you can use the `split` method:


```python
test = 'this is a test'
t = test.split()
```


```python
t
```




    ['this', 'is', 'a', 'test']



An optional argument called a **delimiter** specifies which characters to use as word boundaries. The following example uses a hyphen as a delimiter:


```python
hyp = 'H-E-L-L-O'
t = hyp.split("-")
```


```python
t
```




    ['H', 'E', 'L', 'L', 'O']



- `join` is the inverse of `split`. 
- It takes a list of strings and concatenates the elements. 
- `join` is a string method, so you have to invoke it on the delimiter and pass the list as a parameter:


```python
t = ['H', 'E', 'L', 'L', 'O']
'-'.join(t)
```




    'H-E-L-L-O'




```python
'&'.join(t)
```




    'H&E&L&L&O'




```python
' '.join(t)
```




    'H E L L O'



## List arguments
When you pass a list to a function, the function gets a reference to the list. If the function modifies the list, the caller sees the change. For example, delete_head removes the first element from a list:


```python
def delete_head(t):
    del t[0]
```

The parameter t and the variable letters are aliases for the same object. 


```python
letters = list('abcd')
letters
```




    ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']




```python
delete_head(letters)
```


```python
letters
```




    ['b', 'c', 'd']



It is important to distinguish between operations that modify lists and operations that create new lists. For example, the append method modifies a list, but the + operator creates a new list.


```python
t1 = [1, 2]
t1.append(3)
```


```python
t1
```




    [1, 2, 3]




```python
t2 # Returns None
```

The return value from append is `None`.


```python
t3 = t1 + [4]
t1
```




    [1, 2, 3]




```python
t3
```




    [1, 2, 3, 4]



- The result of the operator is a new list, and the original list is unchanged.

- This difference is important when you write functions that are supposed to modify lists. For example, this function does not delete the head of a list:


```python
def bad_delete_head(t):
    t = t[1:]              # WRONG!
```

The slice operator creates a new list and the assignment makes t refer to it, but that doesn’t affect the caller.


```python
t4 = [1, 2, 3]
bad_delete_head(t4)
```


```python
t4
```




    [1, 2, 3]



- At the beginning of bad_delete_head, t and t4 refer to the same list. At the end, t refers to a new list, but t4 still refers to the original, unmodified list.

- An alternative is to write a function that creates and returns a new list. For example, tail returns all but the first element of a list:




```python
def tail(t):
    return t[1:]
```

This function leaves the original list unmodified. Here’s how it is used:


```python
letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']
rest = tail(letters)
rest
```




    ['b', 'c']




```python
letters = list('abcdefghi')
letters[::-1]
```




    ['i', 'h', 'g', 'f', 'e', 'd', 'c', 'b', 'a']




```python
x = [1,2,3]
x[::-1]
```




    [3, 2, 1]



## Debugging
Careless use of lists can lead to long hours of debugging. 

### Most list methods modify the argument and return `None`

- This is the opposite of the string methods, which return a new string and leave the original alone.
- If you are used to writing string code like this:

```python
word = word.strip()
```
It is tempting to write list code like this:

```python
t = t.sort()           # WRONG!
```
- Sort returns `None`, the next operation you perform with t is likely to fail.

### Pick an idiom and stick with it

Part of the problem with lists is that there are too many ways to do things. For example, to remove an element from a list, you can use `pop`, `remove`, `del`, or `slice`

To add an element, you can use the append method or the `+` operator. Assuming that t is a list and x is a list element, 

**These are correct:**

```python
t.append(x)
t = t + [x]
t += [x]
```

**And these are wrong:**

```python
t.append([x])          # WRONG!
t = t.append(x)        # WRONG!
t + [x]                # WRONG!
t = t + x              # WRONG!
```

- Try out each of these examples to make sure you understand what they do. 

- Notice that only the last one causes a runtime error; the other three are legal, but they do the wrong thing.

### Make copies to avoid aliasing.

If you want to use a method like sort that modifies the argument, but you need to keep the original list as well, you can make a copy.


```python
t = [3, 1, 2]
t2 = t[:]
t2.sort()
```


```python
t
```




    [3, 1, 2]




```python
t2
```




    [1, 2, 3]



In this example you could also use the built-in function sorted, which returns a new, sorted list and leaves the original alone.


```python
t2 = sorted(t)
```


```python
t
```




    [3, 1, 2]




```python
t2
```




    [1, 2, 3]
