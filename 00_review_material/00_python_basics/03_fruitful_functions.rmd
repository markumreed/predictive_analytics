# Functions: Part 2
## Fruitful Functions (For Business)

Many of the Python functions we have used (the `math` functions) produce return values. But the functions we’ve written are all void:
    
   - they have an effect, like printing a value, but 
   - they don’t have a return value 
   
Today you'll learn to write fruitful functions

## Return values

- Calling the function generates a return value, which we (usually) assign to a variable or use as part of an expression

- Today we are going to write fruitful functions

- The first exampe is `cash_flow`, which returns your cash flow given income and expenses


```python
def cash_flow(income, expenses):
    cf = income - expenses
    return cf
```


```python
cash_flow(10000, 9000.0)
```




    1000.0



We have seen the return statement before, but in a fruitful function the return statement includes an expression. 

This statement means: “Return immediately from this function and use the following expression as a return value.” 

We could have written this function more concisely:


```python
def cash_flow(income, expenses):
    return income - expenses
```

##### Incremental development

- As you write larger functions, you might find yourself spending more time debugging.

- To deal with increasingly complex programs, you might want to try a process called **incremental development**. 


### Example

Suppose you want to calculate *compound interest*:

- Compound interest refers to calculating the *compounded interest*, not just the interest gained on the principal invested or borrowed amount.


$$A = P(1+\frac{r}{n})^{nt}$$


where

- A = New Principal (principal + interest)
- P = Original Principal Amount
- r = Annual Nominal Interest Rate (Float)
- t = Overall length of time the interest is applied
- n = Compounding frequency

#### Step 1
The first step is to consider what a `comp_interest` function should look like. 
- What are the inputs (parameters) and what is the output (return value)?

    - In this case, the inputs are four numbers. 
    - The return value is the accrued amount (principal + interest) AND the total compound interest (represented by a floating-point value)

#### Step 2
Write an outline of the function:

```python
def comp_interest(principal, rate, n, t):
    return 0.0
```

- Obviously, this version doesn’t compute our values; it always returns zero. 
- But it is syntactically correct, and it runs, which means that you can test it before you make it more complicated.

```python
comp_interest(5000, 0.08, 4, 2) # Easy to solve
0.0
```

At this point we have confirmed that the function is syntactically correct, and we can start adding code to the body. 

#### Step 3
A reasonable next step is to find the subvalues.

```python
def comp_interest(principal, rate, n, t):
    r_n = 1 + (rate / n)
    nt = n * t
    print('Compound rate: ', r_n)
    print('Frequency: ', nt)
    return 0.0
```

If the function is working, it should display: 

```python
comp_interest(5000,0.08,4,2)
Compound rate: 1.02
Frequency: 8
```

#### Step 4
Next compute the result

```python
def comp_interest(principal, rate, n, t):
    r_n = 1 + (rate / n)
    nt = n * t
    result = principal*r_n**nt
    return round(result,2)
```

When you start out, you should add only a line or two of code at a time. As you gain more experience, you might find yourself writing and debugging bigger chunks. Either way, incremental development can save you a lot of debugging time.

The key aspects of the process are:

1. Start with a working program and make small incremental changes. At any point, if there is an error, you should have a good idea where it is.
2. Use variables to hold intermediate values so you can display and check them.
3. Once the program is working, you might want to remove some of the scaffolding or consolidate multiple statements into compound expressions, but only if it does not make the program difficult to read.

### Example 2


$$B = R [\frac{1-(1+i)^{-(n-x)}}{i}]$$


```python
def rem_bal(reg_pay, i, num_pay, pay_made):
    return 0.0
```


```python

```


```python

```


```python
def rem_bal(reg_pay, i, num_pay, pay_made):
    a = 1+i
    b = -(num_pay-pay_made)
    c = 1 - a**b
    d = c / i
    result = reg_pay * d
    return round(result,2)
```


```python
rem_bal(5000, 0.08, 4, 2)
```

## Boolean Functions

Functions can return booleans, which is often convenient for hiding complicated tests inside functions. For example:

```python
def is_divisible(x, y):
    if x % y == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```
It is common to give boolean functions names that sound like yes/no questions

The result of the == operator is a boolean, so we can write the function more concisely by returning it directly:

```python
def is_divisible(x, y):
    return x % y == 0
```

## Recursion (Factorial Example)

- The factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

$$0! = 1$$
$$n! = n(n-1)!$$

If you can write a recursive definition of something, you can write a Python program to evaluate it

### Step 1: Decide on parameters

- `factorial` takes an integer

```python
def factorial(n):
    
```

### Step 2: Add basic conditional argument
- if the argument happens to be 0, we return 1:

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
```

### Step 3: Make it recursive
Otherwise, we have to make a recursive call to 
1. find the factorial of n-1
2. multiply it by n

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        recurse = factorial(n-1)
        result = n * recurse
        return result
```

This should look similar to our `countdown` example


```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        recurse = factorial(n-1)
        result = n * recurse
        return result
```


```python
factorial(500)
```

## Fibonacci Example

          fibonacci(0) = 0 
 	 	fibonacci(1) = 1 
 	 	fibonacci(n) = fibonacci(n−1) + fibonacci(n−2)
        
Translated into a Python function:


```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n ==0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```


```python
fibonacci(4)
```

## Checking types: Factorial Example 2

What happens if we call `factorial` and give it 1.5 as an argument?

```python
factorial(1.5)
RuntimeError: Maximum recursion depth exceeded
```

- It looks like an infinite recursion. How can that be? 
- The function has a base case—when `n == 0`. 
- But if n is not an integer, we can miss the base case and recurse forever

### Solution

- Use the built-in function `isinstance` to verify the type of the argument


```python
def factorial(n):
    if not isinstance(n, int):
        print('Factorial is only defined for integers.')
        return None
    elif n < 0:
        print('Factorial is not defined for negative integers.')
        return None
    elif n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)
```


```python
factorial('bob')
```

    Factorial is only defined for integers.



```python
factorial(-2)
```

    Factorial is not defined for negative integers.



```python
factorial(0)



```
