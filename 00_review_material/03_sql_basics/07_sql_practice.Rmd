# SQL Practice

Get to know the three Tables in this database:

1. ARTIST
1. ALBUM
1. TRACK
1. Playlist
1. PlaylistTrack


```{sql, eval=FALSE}
%%sql

SELECT name FROM track

LIMIT(3);
```


## Question 1:

Create a table that contains the artists name, album title and tracks.

Use the `GROUP_CONCAT` function to concat the Track names.

Group by artist name and album title.


```{sql, eval=FALSE}

SELECT 
ARTIST.NAME AS ARTIST_NAME,
TITLE AS ALBUM_TITLE,
GROUP_CONCAT(TRACK.Name,', ') AS TRACKS

FROM ARTIST INNER JOIN ALBUM
ON ARTIST.ArtistId = ALBUM.ArtistId

INNER JOIN TRACK
ON TRACK.AlbumId = Album.AlbumId

GROUP BY 1,2
LIMIT(5);
```


## Question 2:

Grunge Playlists:

Join Playlist and PlaylistTrack, Track and Album, Album and Artist.

Where the playlist is grunge:

(HINT: Grunge = 16)


```{sql, eval=FALSE}

SELECT 
Playlist.Name as PLAYLIST_NAME,
Artist.Name as ARTIST_NAME,
Track.Name as TRACK_NAME,
Album.Title as ALBUM_TITLE

FROM Playlist INNER JOIN PlaylistTrack
ON Playlist.PlaylistId = PlaylistTrack.PlaylistId

INNER JOIN Track
ON PlaylistTrack.TrackId = Track.TrackId

INNER JOIN Album
ON Track.AlbumId = Album.AlbumId

INNER JOIN Artist
ON Album.ArtistId = Artist.ArtistId

WHERE Playlist.PlaylistId = 16
```


## Question Prep
Get to know the following tables:

1. Invoice
1. Customer


```{sql, eval=FALSE}

SELECT * FROM Invoice
LIMIT(3);
```


## Question 3:

Find total sales by country, round to 2 decimal places.


```{sql, eval=FALSE}

SELECT BillingCountry as COUNTRY,
round(SUM(Total),2) as TOTAL_SALES

FROM Invoice
GROUP BY BillingCountry
```



## Question 4:
Calculate Total sales by customer, give their first and last names. Round to 2 decimals.


```{sql, eval=FALSE}

SELECT 
Customer.CustomerId,
FirstName,
LastName,

round(SUM(Total),2) as TOTAL_SALES

FROM Invoice INNER JOIN Customer 
ON Invoice.CustomerId = Customer.CustomerId

GROUP BY Customer.CustomerId, FirstName, LastName


```
